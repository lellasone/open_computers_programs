# Mine V2

This set of programs supports an ender-chest + robot linear world eater. It
is composed of an in-world support center to keep the ender chest supplied
and some number of robots to do the actual mining. 


In testing so far a single chest seems to be able to handle ~50 bots if setup
with care. To a first approximation each robot can mine a chunk every 16 hours.

## Waking and Counting



## Robot Replacement. 
Currently the addition of new robots must be done manually. In the future there
may be code and designs for automatically deploying robots.
