This repo is a storage spot for my various open computers programs. A short
summary of what is what is below. 

mine.lua - a good mid-tier mining program. This is a single robot mining 
           program that moves in a straight line gathering materials. It
           uses a scaffolding system for movement (thus no hover required)
           and an ender-chest for item transport. Moderate additional 
           infrestructure is required to maintain the chest. 

           I would consider this to be moderatly reliable. Robots should
           bring in well more than their cost before ultimatly getting
           stuck.
