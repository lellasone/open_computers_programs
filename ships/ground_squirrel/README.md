## Summary
The USS groundsquirell is the flagship of it’s class and was originally 
designed to provide security and force projection to the exodus fleet. 
It remains the smallest dedicated warship produced by Allied Industries, and it
often serves as a dedicated escort for capital ships or fixed installations.

Six auto-loading missile launchers, a spaced upper hull, and it’s compact 
profile make the GS class a surprisingly tough fighter at close range. 
It can reliably threaten most light cruisers and even many older heavy 
cruisers when deployed in a squadron. The groundsquirell class can be easily 
operated by a a crew of one which, along with it’s low cost, makes GS class 
destroyers a common first command within the Allied fleet.

## Weapons
The GS has six T2 launchers arranged as a single battery. They are fed by
a single obsideon chest and the ship can reliably fire about 3 volleys
per minute. The GS lacks a fire control computer, but has two balconies
and a protected roof which can be used to manually target the launchers 
with a radar gun or laser-designator. 

The GS's auto-loader defaults to filling the magazine with breaching
missiles, but specialized volleys can be aranged by inserting
alternate missiles into the obsideon chest (missiles are pulled 6 at
a time in row-column order).

## Defenses
The GS has a standard single layer hull with a double-thickness sceiling plate
above the front (flight computer and power) and rear (crafting, supply, sleep)
and a single layer sceiling over missile compartment. It also has an additional
layer of upper armor spaced 2 blocks above the hull.

In practice this means ship can reliably take a small volley of breaching
missiles (no more than two coincident hits per 3x3 area). The GS class should
also shrug off most T2 special missiles (sonic, thermobaric, ect) when
undamaged. 

The GS's small size makes it hard to hit without an advanced targeting computer
, but also means that even a single hit from high-tier missiles (nuclear,
exothermic, hypersonic, ect) is enough to disable the ship. 

There are two turrets (one front one rear) that provide basic defense against
mobs and players within the ship. There are no external anti-entity defenses.

## Logistics and Supply
A lava based power system and limited magazine capacity mean that the 
GS will 
never operate completely without a home base. It's power system is however fairly efficient
meaning that even fairly small cruisers or bases can support several 
GS class destroyers. The onboard transporter facilitates this sort of arangment and 
most GS class destroyers are asigned to a mothership or motherbase during peacetime. 

In combat the GS has sufficent fuel (a few hundred jumps) and missiles (6 minutes of firing) to 
see it through most engagements, and it can ussually operate
independently for all but the longest wars. 

The GS lacks all but the most rudementary processing for items, but
does have two bunks and a small chest ussually reserved for 
holding food armor, and weapons. During peacetime the GS finds work as a 
transport and general purpose shuttle operating near established infrastructure.

## Tactics and Strategy
When it comes to other military ships the GS will be outgunned by just
about everything it comes across so numbers and careful positioning are the 
name of the game
Against other warships the GS should try to close to within visual range where
it's launchers can be targeted by laser range finder and the lack of a
targeting computer is less burdensome. Against fixed installations which do not
require dynamic targeting thethe GS should aim to engage from extreme distances
where it's mobility and small size will make it essentially unhitable. The 
dangerzone is ranges to large to allow for visual targeting, but too close to
allow the GS to jump automatically targeted volleys.
