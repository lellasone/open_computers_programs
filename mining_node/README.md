# Mining Nodes
Control software for a set of warpdrive based mining ships designed for strip
mining. Each ship features some number of builders, all nodes run the same 
firmware. Dimension based differences are handled in hardware as needed.

## Power
Mining nodes have both internal and external power sources. It is important
that any power shuttoffs (say wireless receivers keyed to the grid charge
level) not disable power to the computer. In the event of a total power failure
grid restoration should also lead to a new computer boot.
